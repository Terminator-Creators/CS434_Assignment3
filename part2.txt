1. Take The training data set,

2. generate T bootstrap training sets (S1 ... Sn) from training set S

3. For each:

4. take all outputs and run a majority vote

5. output majority vote



1. load in the training set --DONE

2. Start with empty set S'
    Add a random point from S to S' until len(S') = len(S)

3. 

4. Keep an output list that appends each bagged output

5.Poll for majority
